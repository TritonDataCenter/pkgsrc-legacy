WARNING: The tests this module does should never be included as part of a
normal CPAN install!
  This module is intended as a tool for module authors who would like to
easily test that a module release will not break dependencies. This is
particularly useful for module authors (like myself) who have modules which
are a dependency of many other modules.  
 --  How It Works --
Internally, this module will download dependencies from CPAN and run their
tests. If those dependencies in turn have unsatisfied dependencies, they
are installed into a temporary directory. These second-level (and third-,
etc) dependencies are not tested.
  In order to avoid prompting, this module sets $ENV{PERL_AUTOINSTALL} to
--defaultdeps and sets $ENV{PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT} to a true value.
  Nonetheless, some ill-behaved modules will still wait for a prompt.
Unfortunately, because of the way this module attempts to keep output
to a minimum, you won't see these prompts. Patches are welcome.

 -- Running Tests in Parallel --
If you're testing a lot of modules, you might benefit from running tests in
parallel. You'll need to have Parallel::ForkManager installed for this to
work.

  Set the $ENV{PERL_TEST_DM_PROCESSES} env var to a value greater than 1 to
qenable parallel testing.
