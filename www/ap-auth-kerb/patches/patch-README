+Constrained Delegation
+----------------------
+S4U2Proxy, or constrained delegation, enables a service to use a client's
+ticket to itself to request another ticket for delegation. The KDC
+checks krbAllowedToDelegateTo to decide if it will issue a new ticket.
+If KrbConstrainedDelegation is enabled the server will use its own credentials
+to retrieve a delegated ticket for the user. For this to work the user must
+have a forwardable ticket (though the delegation flag need not be set).
+The server needs a valid credentials cache for this to work.
+
+The module itself will obtain and manage the necessary credentials.
