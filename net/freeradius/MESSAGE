$NetBSD$

This package provides the FreeRADIUS server with certain core modules.
Other modules such as rest, SQL backends, redis, etc are provided by
other packages such as net/freeradius3-mysql.

Some authentication methods require SSL configuration in order to
work. To bootstrap a self-signed SSL certificate for those
authentication methods, one can run

      ${BOOTSTRAP}
